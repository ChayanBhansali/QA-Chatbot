# QA-Chatbot



The QA-Chatbot is a project designed to provide users with a conversational interface for querying information contained within a PDF document. Leveraging the capabilities of ChainlIT, ChatGPT API, Chroma, and Langchain, this project enables users to ask questions related to the contents of a PDF and receive relevant answers in real-time.

I used openAI and chainlit documentations as reference, here are the links to them:\
